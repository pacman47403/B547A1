This report satisfies the requirements of assignment
1~\cite{2017myersa1handout}, which requires us to perform a
\textit{comprehensive} threat model a password manager.  We are
allowed discretion in the choice of architectures but the architecture
should provide for the remembering of many passwords for websites,
products, appliances and other uses which require passwords.
\par The report is limited to no more than 7 pages of diagrams and 40
pages total length.  The final product is a threat model of the system
and any other documentation that would be necessary to understand how
the proposed system would run.  If any sections of the threat model
are empty, they should still be included in the report and the report
should indicate that they were intentionally left empty.
